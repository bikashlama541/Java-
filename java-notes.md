## Java Notes
### OOP
  #### Abstraction
    * Describe the entity of the class.
    * Different entities involves different datas of a single variable let's say a person can have many entities.
    
  #### Inheritance
    * A parent and child methodology. 
    * use keywords extends to the child class.
    * Child gets all the attributes from the parent but parent won't get a attribute from child neither from grandchild.
       ( One directional )
    * Protected defined variable can be accessed by child but private defined variable can't be accessed by child.
    * Only public defined data type or method can be accessed by child class.
    
   #### Encapsulation
     * A way of using private data type or method to another class.
     * It can be done by calling a  different method setter(sets data) and getter(gets data type).
     
### Interface
  * Interface in java is like a class where methods are only called but the code is not written in method.
  * It is used to set a requirements for a class.
